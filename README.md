# rock-paper-scissors-js-project

# Overview

This is my submission for the Javascript Portfolio Project. The application is called "Rock-Paper-Scissors", a simple game that you play against the computer to see how many times you can win in a row against it. A user can create an account, and play against the computer as many times as they want. The user's best score gets displayed on the page, and if the score is amongst the top 10 best scores of any user, it will show up in the leaderboard. This was my attempt, to create a rock-paper-scissors game against the computer, recording a users best score and displaying the best 10 scores on the leaderboard.

# Getting Started

To get started, you can fork and clone this repo. After you have forked and cloned this repo, you can head over to your ide and run the following command: git clone (repo you cloned goes here without the parentheses) and then press enter. On the following line you can run the command: cd (name of repo). Once thats done, you can open the project by opening up your favorite text editor. I use Visual Studio Code, so in my case it would be: code . to open the whole project.

Once this is done, you have to run: cd rock-paper-scissors-js-project-backend. What this will do is lead you to the backend directory so you can then run: rails server. When you run the rails server, the app will have access to the rails api, where you can record your data when you play the game. Copy the html file path and paste it in the browser so you can start playing!
